					"Have you ever wondered what the food you eat everyday can tell you about where you come from? 
					<aside id="tolkien"> “If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.” <br> ― J.R.R. Tolkien </aside>
					Have you ever wondered why people from different parts of the world eat different types of food? 
					Do you ever ask yourself why certain foods or culinary traditions are so important to your culture?
					There is more of a connection between food and culture than you may think.

				<p>
					On an individual level, we grow up eating the food of our cultures. It becomes a part of who each of us are.
					Many of us associate food from our childhood with warm feelings and good memories and it ties us to 
					our families, holding a special and personal value for us. Food from our family often becomes the comfort
					food we seek as adults in times of frustration and stress. When I was sick as a kid, I couldn’t eat rice 
					because I was too weak, so my mother would cook soup and bring it to bed for me. The smell and taste of the 
					soup became something very familiar to me. Now, whenever I feel tired or stressed, I remember the soup my mom 
					used to make for me and I feel hungry for that soup." -Article written by Chau B Le

				<p>
					Food is a powerful tool for connecting people.  I think that this is the basic reason why people cook for each other. 
					It allows them to share in something as a community of people.  It brings comfort and pleasure in many ways when you
					take a bite of something delicious while sharing a laugh with the people around you.  For those of us who love baking 
					bread, it is not much different.  We work hard at our craft in order to be able to share it with the ones we love around 
					us and also with the ones we have not yet formed a connection with.

				"Bread has been an important staple food product to many cultures over the centuries. It is referred to as the “staff of life”
				in the Bible. Humans have eaten some form of bread since the Neolithic era, when cereals were crushed and mixed with water to
				form a thick paste that could be cooked over the fire. Stone mechanisms were used for smashing and grinding various cereals to 
				remove the inedible outer husks and to make the resulting grain into palatable and versatile food."
