			<h1> My Story </h1>
			<p> 
				I am a college student at Harding University. I am studying Computer Science and breadmaking is a big hobby
				of mine.  While some have mentioned to me if I love it so much I should make a career of it, I believe
				it would be best to leave it as a hobby.  I am uncertain that I would love it as much if I had to wake up 
				<img src="me.jpg" alt="3 brothers doing a jumping kick" class="pictures">
				at 4 am every morning to do it.  I also have a passion for Computer Science and most of all the important 
				people in my life and the friends I have here at Harding.

				My passion for breadmaking was something given to me by my Aunt and Grandma.  The first person to teach me
				something about breadmaking was my Aunt when she taught me to make dinner rolls.  Later my grandma taught
				me to make buttermilk biscuits which are still one of my favorite things to make to this day.  For a few 
				years after this though I stopped making bread and lost interest and the book my aunt had gotten me collected
				dust.  Thankfully I finally gave it a shot again and have been working hard teaching myself all there is to know 
				for about a year at this point.
